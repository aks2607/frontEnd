ðŸ”¹ 1. Critical Rendering Path & Page Load Optimization

Understanding Critical Rendering Path

HTML/CSS/JS blocking and how to minimize it

Lazy loading (images, components, routes)

Code splitting and dynamic imports

Minification and compression (e.g., using gzip or Brotli)

Defer vs Async for <script>

Removing unused CSS/JS (Tree shaking, PurgeCSS)



---

ðŸ”¹ 2. Network Optimization

Caching strategies (HTTP cache headers, service workers)

CDN usage for assets and static files

Reducing number of requests (sprite sheets, bundling)

Reducing payload size (images, fonts, videos)

Prefetching, Preloading, Preconnecting



---

ðŸ”¹ 3. JavaScript Performance

Reducing bundle size (webpack, Rollup optimizations)

Avoid unnecessary re-renders in React (memoization, useMemo, useCallback)

Debouncing and throttling

Avoid memory leaks (event listeners, intervals, closures)



---

ðŸ”¹ 4. Image & Asset Optimization

Use modern image formats: WebP, AVIF

Serve responsive images (<picture>, srcset)

Lazy load offscreen images

Compress large assets



---

ðŸ”¹ 5. Performance Monitoring Tools

Lighthouse (for scoring and suggestions)

Chrome DevTools (Network tab, Performance tab)

WebPageTest, PageSpeed Insights

Core Web Vitals (CLS, LCP, FID)



---

ðŸ”¹ 6. React/Vue/Angular Specific Optimizations

Virtual DOM diffing: how it works and how to avoid unnecessary updates

Avoid anonymous functions in render

Use production build optimizations (e.g., NODE_ENV=production)

Component lazy loading



---

ðŸ”¹ 7. Accessibility & Perceived Performance

Show skeleton loaders or spinners for feedback

Use requestIdleCallback or requestAnimationFrame smartly

Prioritize above-the-fold content



---

ðŸ”¹ 8. Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

Service Workers for caching

App Shell architecture

Offline support



---

ðŸŽ¯ Bonus Topics (Advanced)

Web Workers (for CPU-heavy tasks)

Efficient DOM manipulation

Server-side rendering (SSR)

Static site generation (SSG) like with Next.js

  The Critical Rendering Path is the sequence of steps the browser goes through to convert the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the screen.ye optimise ho sakta hai
